I'm trying to add a blog to the website.
I have decided the API for interacting with said blog should be developed with ExpressJS.

We need at least two endpoints, a GET and POST for blog posts.

We need a server to host blog posts.

Blog posts have only a few main parts of data:

ID
Title
Author
Content

Any attachments will have to be embedded in the html of the post content.

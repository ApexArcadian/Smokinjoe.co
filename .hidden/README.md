Smokinjoe.co has become a kindof fuzzy project goal. I bought the domain expecting to expand into some sort of business, with the initial goal of using it as an archival repository for media that I wanted to share between devices or friends. This goal devolved quickly and with the release of my album in April, the entire focus of the website became music. Now the site has camera IPs, the fucking recipe for meth, a minecraft server page that I basically stole but I think the guy is cool with it because I gave credit, and a page with some really bad social media cards for my friends.
The whole site is **messy**, un-unified, and mostly useless. Part of the problem in my eyes is that it is all static HTML/css with some really trashy base js. This is fine and good for the purpose of advertising music hosting some video links and what not but I really would like a dashboard that serves me as a home, and a landing page that I can show people that will introduce them to my world of things I do or can do for/with them. This is meant to become a network, my network, of things and people I find fun or useful.

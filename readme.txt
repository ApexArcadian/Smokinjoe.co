Smokinjoe.co is my personal domain and passion project archive.
It is not complete, and never will be, but a good start would be
to retroactively add pages for my existing projects.

I will start by saying I plan on using NGINX to serve my pages.

The first real media page should be dedicated to the ZOMBIES! project.
Second should be a music/.flp file archive.

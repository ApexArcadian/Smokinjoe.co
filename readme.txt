Smokinjoe.co is my personal domain and passion project archive.
It is not complete, and never will be, but a good start would be
to retroactively add pages for my existing projects.

///////I will start by saying I plan on using NGINX to serve my pages.
COMPLETELY FALSE GITHUB PAGES IS SICK.

NGNIX would make a good reverse proxy for subdomains like an archive or some locally hosted service.

The first real media page should be dedicated to the ZOMBIES! project.
Second should be a music/.flp file archive.

As of yet, the master branch should function only as a backup, never to be actively used or edited (outside of merges with the dev branch).
It can act as an intermediary as well, for pull requests to merge from dev to the gh-pages branch.

Smokinjoe.co is my personal domain and passion project archive.
It is not complete, and never will be, but a good start would be
to retroactively add pages for my existing projects.

As of yet, the master branch should function only as a backup, never to be actively used or edited (outside of merges with the dev branch).
It can act as an intermediary as well, for pull requests to merge from dev to the gh-pages branch.

Mail goals:
More functionality on the cam viewing page. Instead of viewing the focus should be on tutorials. Hand picking cameras is boring so eventually I want to automate the process of finding cameras (if not thru some sort of api, maybe just webscram insec cam).
